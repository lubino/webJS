RequireJS is a JavaScript file and module loader. It is optimized for in-browser use,
but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like Rhino and Node.
Using a modular script loader like RequireJS will improve the speed and quality of your code.

r.js is a command line tool for running JavaScript scripts that use the Asynchronous Module Definition API (AMD)
for declaring and using JavaScript modules and regular JavaScript script files.

require.r.js is a smaller version of require.js, which can be used for composed AMDs with r.js command line tool.
It is only 295 bytes length and it implements two basic methods of RequireJS:
- define
- require

So if you are using require.js and you are building your final JavaScript with r.js, you don't have to include
the big one version "require.js", you can use "require.r.js".
