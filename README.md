     - Uses requireJS as prevention against messy spaghetti code
     - Supports Browser-based mode for development without over-complex tools and processes

# App Demo

    A page parsed from HTML to JavaScript. Is renders the page immediately (see source for more info) http://lubino.github.io/webJS/src/example.html

    And YES, it is all in JavaScript, so there in no issue to create a live parser without server connection, try http://lubino.github.io/webJS/src/compiler.html
 
# Quick Start

    Download a ZIP file. It contains empty project file structure for quick start. http://lubino.github.io/webJS/empty_project.zip 

    If you want to use it for serious things, you will need nodejs platform to run build.sh script. 
    If you just want to try it in "browser based mode" for fun or development reasons, you don't need to run build.sh and you don't need any node platform. 
    Just download empty_project.zip, unzip it and open the "source/index.html" file in your browser.

# Simple Deployment

    In the end, are your HTML and JS files are joined into only one JS file.
    It's so cool!
