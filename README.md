# webJS: HTML2JS compiler for Single Page Interface web apps
Browser-side MVP component based framework for single page interface written in JavaScript. See http://lubino.github.com/webJS/ for more info.
 
JavaScript library for online/offline web pages and apps. 
It translates HTML files to well optimized reusable JS for dynamic page rendering based on MVC patterns.
The best way to create dynamic pages and apps.

# Features

- Fast learning curve: HTML, CSS and JavaScript is all you need to know for 90% of activities
- Uses requireJS as prevention against messy spaghetti code
- Supports Browser-based mode for development without over-complex tools and processes
- MVC based data, logic and graphic separation

# App Demo

A page parsed from HTML to JavaScript. This example compiles (on the fly in your browser) one HTML page and opens it as a part of another page http://lubino.github.io/webJS/src/example.html

And YES, it is all in JavaScript, so there is also a live html2javascript compiler (and it works offline).
Open http://lubino.github.io/webJS/src/compiler.html and choose some HTML file from your drive (click on "from file" button).
 
# Quick Start

Download a ZIP file. It contains empty project file structure for your quick start. http://lubino.github.io/webJS/empty_project.zip 

If you want to use it for serious things, you will need nodejs platform to run build.sh script. 
If you just want to try it in "browser based mode" for fun or development reasons, you don't need to run build.sh and you don't need any node platform. 
Just download empty_project.zip, unzip it and open the "source/index.html" file in your browser.

# Simple Deployment

In the end, all your HTML and JS files are joined into one JS file. Ready to run on any page. One JS reference on page is all you need. It's so cool!
